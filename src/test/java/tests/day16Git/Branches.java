    *This is basically u create a different environment, why do we need this?
    * Default one is Master, but you can work on your own Branch and at the end of the day you can propose your chnages on
    *                                   the main branch-master. it calls-pull request (this will reviewed by someone (owner of repository, some lead, main tester, main developer etc..) then...)
    *You can work on ur own branch then push to main repository
    * Branch: independend line of development
    * when u have 2 branches you can merge them
    * When you create a new branch it means u re getting new directory

   /* everyone has their own branch and we do not commit to master branch directly. Instead we work our branches.
        Master branch has latest stable and verified code.
        Once I created my task, I created a pull request and that will be verified by test lead/other tester
